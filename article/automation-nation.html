          <p>I was finally able to sit and focus on automating our grow last night! I think the thought of travel has me wanting to ensure that if we do go anywhere, we don't have to rely on relatives to water the plants.</p>
<p>I started first by simply putting the old setup back in place, but immediately noticed that 2 of the 6 outlets were not putting out water. Here is a photo of one of the ones that was working.</p>

<p>I figured the issue was related to how long the hose was and how chaotic it was setup. I sat down and began to trim and optimize the path of water for each plant, ensuring that each plant got just enough length of hose to fit in the pot comfortably. Here is a picture of all the hose we were able to avoid using! We removed one outlet as we only needed 5.</p>

<p>That left us with this setup!</p>

<p>As you can see, I have my 5 gallon water bag on the left, and I have it set to water the plants for 3 minutes every day. Since I'll be home to monitor the output, I plan on adjusting this timing as needed, and every two days manually water in a circular pattern to encourage diverse root growth. I don't want the roots to congregate only around one spot where the drip system is for the whole grow, but at least while I'm traveling or on days I forget it's not a big issue.</p>
<p>As you can see, the nutrient burn is getting better by the day on Haze! I'm flushing the soil out with only water slowly, and it's definitely helping. I think I should be doing a much bigger flush of water, but I don't want to stress the plant too much.</p>
<p>Here is a final picture for today of my babies! As you can see, haze is getting really close! I also took the time to blow the dust out of my fan, it looks a lot cleaner now!</p>
